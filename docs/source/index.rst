Puck Tracker
============

Puck Tracker is an application for tracking samples shipped to the MX beamlines at the
Australian Synchrotron. It consists of two components:

* `pucktracker-server <https://github.com/AustralianSynchrotron/pucktracker-server>`_ which
  stores data in a MongoDB database and allows updates via HTTP and WebSocket APIs
* `pucktracker-client <https://github.com/AustralianSynchrotron/pucktracker-client>`_ which
  provides a graphical user interface for viewing and updating the dewars, pucks and samples
  tracked by the server
